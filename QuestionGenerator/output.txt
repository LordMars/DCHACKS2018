listed. 

Just because you write them down, don’t think that the ideas you come up with now are _______?
engraved in stone.

Some speakers, like Nicole, integrate their central idea and preview into one blueprint sentence: Obsolete computers are _______?

Like Nicole, he generated reasons for his central idea, which in this case were “dangers at each step of the process” and “corrupt legal maneuvering that protects it.” He decided at this early point in the speech to mention that there is _______?

Here’s a sample outline for a speech about an object: TOPIC: Dead Sea Scrolls GENERAL PURPOSE: To inform SPECIFIC PURPOSE:  At the end of my speech, the audience should be able to describe how the Dead Sea Scrolls were found, why they are _______?
important to society, and the key content of the ancient manuscripts. 

A speech about a procedure usually focuses on how a process is _______?

a unique, authentic individual. 

Even though you might have been in elementary school, chances are _______?
that you clearly remember where you were and what you were doing on that and other similarly fateful days. 

The following principles, concepts, and theories might be topics of speeches about ideas: Principles of communication Freedom of speech Evolution Theories of aging Islam Communal living Positive psychology Most speeches about ideas are _______?
organized topically (by logical subdivisions of the central idea) or according to complexity (from simple ideas to more com- plex ones). 

The ego mediates between the needs of the id and the reality of what is _______?
happening around us. 

Just because an idea, term, or concept has been around for centuries doesn’t mean that it is _______?
easy to understand or that audience members understand the relevance of the information to their own lives. 

The Internet gives us access to a wealth of information, but having access to information is _______?
not the same thing as understanding the information. 

One interesting study made the point that because the information is _______?
clear to you, you’ll likely think that it’s also clear to your listener.2 People were asked to tap the rhythm of well- known songs, such as “Happy Birthday to You” or “The Star-Spangled Banner,” so that another person could guess the song just by hearing the rhythm. 

About half of the people who tapped the song thought that the listener would easily figure out which song was _______?
being tapped. 

Whether it’s how to drive a car or how to care for an aardvark, if you are _______?

Researchers and scholars have found andragogical approaches that are _______?
best for adult learning. 

If you present adult listeners with information that they can apply immediately to their “in-baskets,” they are _______?
more likely to focus on and understand your message.

Research suggests that you can demystify a complex process if you first provide a simple overview of the proc­ ess with an analogy, vivid description, or word picture.6 Use Analogies  If a speaker said, “The Milky Way galaxy is _______?
big,” you would have a vague idea that the cluster of stars and space material that make up the Milky Way was large. 

But if the speaker said, “If the Milky Way galaxy were as big as the continent of North America, our solar system would fit inside a coffee cup,” you’d have a better idea of just how big the Milky Way is _______?
and, by compari- son, how small our solar system is.7 As we discussed in Chapter 8, an analogy is a comparison of two things. 

It’s an especially useful technique to describe com- plex processes because it can help someone to understand something difficult to grasp (the size of the Milky Way) by comparing it to something already under- stood (the size of a coffee cup).8 By helping your listeners compare something new to something they already know or can visualize, you are _______?
helping to make your message clear. 

For the next five days I lived in dreaded anticipation of the forthcoming event.10 Note how effectively her choices of such words and phrases as “my heart stopped,” “panic,” and “dreaded anticipation” describe her terror at the prospect of making a speech—much more so than if she had said simply, “I was _______?
scared.” The more vividly and accurately you can describe emotion, the more inti- mately involved in your description the audience will become.

talking about an unfamiliar or uninteresting speech topic. 

SAMPLE INFORMATIVE SPEECH Roger cleverly captures attention by purposefully starting with an unimaginative topic and using halting delivery that makes listeners wonder, “What’s this really about?” Roger establishes a common bond with his listeners by relating to them as fellow students who are _______?
often confronted with the same problem: how to select a topic for a speech. 

Rather than just saying that we waste time and money when listening to speeches, Roger uses statistics specifically adapted to the audience to whom he is _______?
speaking; this is a good example of being audience-centered. 

Here’s an example: “Would you know what to do if you were stranded, out of gas, at night, without your cell phone?” By getting listeners to ponder your question, you actively engage them in your message rather than relying on them to passively process your words.16 Although Roger’s primary purpose is _______?

to crystallize the central idea of your message into a one-sentence summary of your speech. 

For example, rather than saying, “The specific words that people use and the way in which people express themselves are _______?
influenced by culture and other socioeconomic forces,” say instead, “Language shapes our culture, and culture shapes our language.” The message not only is shorter, but also it uses the technique of antithesis (opposition expressed with a parallel sentence structure), which we discussed in Chapter 12. 

Listeners’ ability to understand may falter.19 You should be especially sensitive to the flow of information if your topic is _______?
new or unfamiliar to your listeners.
